There is some ``Kabuki theater'' whenever introducing a new mathematical
gadget, thanks to \ifblog\href{https://texnicalstuff.blogspot.com/2009/08/object-oriented-math-category-theory-as.html}{category theory}:\else category theory:\fi
we have our new gadget, then we could ask about morphisms (very

quotients, etc.). The exciting thing, as in Kabuki theater, is the order
and manner of presentation.
