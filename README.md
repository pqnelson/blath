This is a backup of notes I'm writing for myself, which are written in
LaTeX and published periodically on my
[blog](https://texnicalstuff.blogspot.com/).

Here I am using a customized version of
[latex2wp](https://github.com/seaneberhard/latex2wp),
which doesn't target wordpress but instead produces some suitably
general HTML output. There are a lot of issues with latex2wp (e.g., it
doesn't close tags properly). I don't try to fix them.

(Future Alex: I just try to make minimal changes so it can be run using
Python 3. It shouldn't require anything more than that. There is one
single command to run to get the HTML output, namely `convert.sh` which
converts `blog.tex` into `blog.html`.)

Separately, the writing, the `.tex`, `.sty` files, are my own writings.
